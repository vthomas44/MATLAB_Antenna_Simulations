  # MATLAB Antenna Simulations

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for analyzing diversity gain, probability density functions, bit error rates (BER), and various antenna combining methods in multi-antenna systems. Each folder contains a specific MATLAB script and documentation explaining its functionality.

## Repository Structure
- **Diversity_Gain_Variance_vs_Antenna_Count/**: Analyzes diversity gain and variance of BER probability based on antenna count.
- **PDF_Selection_Combining_Multiple_Antennas/**: Simulates and plots the Probability Density Function (PDF) for SNR values using selection combining.
- **Diversity_Gain_Combining_Methods/**: Compares different antenna combining methods for diversity gain.
- **BER_Fading_NonFading_CombiningMethods/**: Simulates BER for BPSK modulation under fading and non-fading conditions, with different combining methods.
- **Diversity_Gain_Combining_Methods_SNR_Comparison/**: Compares SNR gains for different diversity combining methods.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the folder of the script you wish to use.
2. Open the MATLAB file in MATLAB.
3. Follow the instructions in the folderâ€™s `README.md` for parameters and usage.
